Abstract - Landslides cause serious impacts such as human casualties, environmental damage, property losses and psychological impacts. The Indonesian government has implemented various measures to mitigate and adapt to the risk of landslides. However, landslide mitigation efforts are still faced with limitations such as the lack of availability of detection equipment compared to the number of landslide-prone locations as well as limited coverage and inefficient power consumption. This research aims to design an Internet of Things (IoT)-based landslide detection tool using Long Range (LoRa) connectivity with fuzzy algorithm. The method used in this research is an experiment where the detection tool is designed and tested with various scenarios and specified parameters. The fuzzy algorithm test results show good sensor performance, such as the MPU6050 sensor with a percentage error on the x-axis of 0.38%, y-axis of 0.61%, ultrasonic sensor 0.65% and soil moisture 2.90%. Fuzzy category testing produces a low percentage error for the normal category of 0.2%, standby 0.2%, alert 0.3%, and watch out 0%. Long Range network quality testing with a testing distance of 8.29 km with a total of 150 tests showed an average RSSI of -109.931 dBm, SNR of -4.84 dB, delay of -0.030 seconds and packet loss of 3.33%. Delay testing with mobile applications for 10 tests resulted in an average of 0.4 seconds which based on the standard is included in the medium category. Overall, the test results show the system is able to work well and run according to its function. There is high alignment and accuracy between the readings on the sensor and the information received by the user in realtime.
